## Project 1: [Agricultural Productivity Differences Between Male and Female Managed Farms](https://github.com/visualizedata/undp/blob/master/work/jaimetanner/FarmSankey/index.html)
 
### Project 1 Caption

Across most African countries, women farmers produce less per hectare than their male counterparts. This visualization uses data from the World Bank as well as the ONE campaign to explore some of the major contributors to this gender gap, allowing the reader to not only see the direct consequences of inequality on agricultural outputs, but also to recognize some of the largest country-specific drivers of the gap, significant information for citizens and policy-makers alike in addressing inequality. 

### Project 1 Research Question

I am visualizing the gap in agricultural productivity between male-managed and female-managed plots of land. 
 

### Project 1 Description

This visual aims to give the reader a greater understanding of the loss of productivity due to the gender gap. The visual hopes to focus the reader on one datapoint at a time, and to illustrate what this agricultural loss may look like for each case addressed in the data set. 
 
### Project 1 Methodology

The only source used in this visualization is the data from question 3.2, as well as some information from the "Leveling the Field" report by the World Bank that is linked through the dataset.

## Project 2: [Child Marriage and the Gender Gap ](https://github.com/visualizedata/undp/blob/master/work/jaimetanner/Gaps/index.html)

### Project 2 Caption
This project explores the relationship between the percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 24 who were married before the age of 18 in select African countries, and how it compares to the UNDPâ€™s Human Development Index (HDI). Each country is represented by a triangle, with the height defined by the percentage of child marriage, the left corner of the triangle base the female score on the HDI, and the right the male score on the HDI. 

### Project 2 Research Question

I am highlighting the relationship between the Gender Development Index and rates of child marriage in each country. 

### Project 2 Description

This project aims to show that there is a relationship between the gap in human development between men and women, and child marriage. Furthermore, rates of intimate partner violence within this unions will also be shown.  

### Project 2 Methodology

The child marriage statistics used in this project is from dataset 2.2. The GDI information is from dataset 1.1. Finally, information on intimate partner violence is available through a UNICEF report entitled "Hidden In Plain Sight", which is listed on the same page as the child marriage statistics that are used in 2.2.
