### Selected Data Sources 

#### 1.1 Linkages Between Empowerment, Gender Equality & Sustainable Human Development 
The data set provides information regarding the human development index  (HDI) for several African countries, as well as information about the health, education, and standard of living for each of these nations. A supplemental data set provides information on trade indicators, gender gaps in agricultural productivity, unemployment, and workplace equality policies.  

The research questions provided with this data set where attractive to me because they seemed fundamental in understanding the data. What are the causes of the gender gap in sub-Saharan Africa?  How have constraints to gender equality affected growth? Addressing these questions may not only highlight the importance of equality, but may provide discernable targets for consideration. 

However what I find most interesting the link between women’s empowerment and sustainable human development. The human development index provides a useful tool in examining major indicators of healthy living, and using these indices as a tool for understanding the effectiveness of women’s empowerment seems like a fascinating project. 

#### 3.2 Modeling impacts on socio-economic indicators , food security, and poverty of gender equality and women’s empowerment. 

The data set provided was the same as that provided for topic 1.1 with a few subtractions. Data again provides information on the human development index for numerous African countries, as well as data on common indicators of health, education, and quality of life for these countries. 

While many questions seem to address the effects that inequalities have on the livelihood and development of women themselves, this topic seems interesting to me because it partially aims to look at the effect of inequality on economic growth. The use of the word “modeling” is also intriguing, as it may be interesting to examine the relationship between positive trends in gender equality and poverty reduction indicators, growth indicators, etc. 

#### 4.1 Rights Based Approach to Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: Existing frameworks for promoting a rights based approach to gender equality and human development in Africa. 

Data set provided again looks at the HDI and contributing factors within many African countries, and also provides a link to an Exxon Mobile data set examining female employment rates within the company, as well as information on the percentage of women on the boards of mining countries around the world. 

The provided research questions under this heading take a somewhat pragmatic approach to applying policies and programs to promote gender equality. The questions revolve around examining existing frameworks for promoting rights-based approaches in Africa, and evaluating how these might be implemented. These questions would most likely require examination of supplemental data sources, however finding potential approaches to shrink the gender gap would absolutely be valuable.

#### Gender Inequality, Income, and Growth: Are Good Times Goof for Women? 
##### David Dollar, Roberta Gatti

This article makes the case that women in developing countries have a lower social status than their male counterparts, and that it is often the case that women are not invested in at a young age, which has an effect on economic growth in the long run (slower growth, reduced income, etc). The measures used by the researchers to evaluate their hypothesis are similar to those used within the UN data set (i. e. access to education, life- expectancy measures, measures of political freedoms). Importantly, they also provide measures of gender inequality in explaining their research methods. 

Finally, as a more theoretical takeaway, the authors showed that increases in wealth resulted in increases in different measures of gender equality. However, it took much longer to see improvements in female education (suggesting that perhaps education indices may not be the best indicators of early changes in the gender gap? ).

#### Measuring Gender (In) Equality
##### Johannes P. Jutting, Christian Morrisson, Jeff Dayton-Johnson and Denis Drechsler

This article introduces the Gender Institutions & Development Data Base, which includes data related to policies, customs, and institutional laws relating to gender. The paper uses this database to predict factors that may be determinants of female participation in the labor force. 

This article describes a dataset that may be very useful in evaluating some of the UNDP’s research questions. They include variables that are related to those provided by the UNDP, such as GDP per capita and health and education measures, while also providing useful information of more social measures, such as family codes and physical, ownership rights, and even measures of physical integrity. 

Article provides an extensive statistical analysis of how many of these variables play indirect roles on the economic role of women, a useful reference going forward. 

#### Advancing Women’s Leadership in Public and Private Sector

This article provided a great background on a possible explanation for continued gender inequalities: an absence of women in decision-making positions in sub-Saharan Africa.  The ratio of men to women in management positions is still very large, and the article describes some of the cultural explanations for this existing gap, such as public stripping of women as punishment for “dislodging men from their rightful places in modern societies”. The article provides data that would be very useful in understanding the origins and barriers of gender inequality in sub-Saharan Africa.

This article examines the effect of a pilot land regularization program that was implemented in Rwanda. The article points out the enormous productivity gap in agriculture in Africa, pointing out that even land currently cultivated Africa receives less than 25% of its potential.  After the Rwandan genocide, the government placed much importance on evaluating land ownership, and in many cases this has lead to a significant decrease in gender discrimination in land access. While the article describes ways of approaching such an act, I primarily thought it was interesting to see the effects of this policy. Examining the land ownership often shows that women (wives, daughters, etc.) have inherited land but have not kept it, and simply enforcing these land rights showed significant effects on land maintenance and productivity.

##### Evelyn Wamboye, Stephanie Seguino

Article evaluates the economic integration of women in Sub-Saharan Africa since globalization 30 years ago.  The analysis included an explanation of how the researchers where able to examine the female-male employment gap in Africa, which may be useful for our inquiries. The article found that while there have been improvements in unemployment rates for women over time in within mineral exporting groups, growth rates have been weak.  There also seems to have been a negative effect on women’s employment rates in non-mineral exporters, identifying an area for further evaluation.

Finally, this article provides an interesting look into the effects that one experiment in women’s empowerment has on young female students in Uganda. As the authors point out that unemployment and early marriage and childbearing are two factors that lead to disempowerment, they investigate the effects of vocational training and sex education to adolescent girls. The results were striking, as women in the experimental group where significantly more likely to seek out jobs, delay marriage and pregnancy, and even the reported rates of sex against their will falls to almost half that of the control group.  These findings address the questions of the topic 4.1 and show a great framework for introducing roads to empowerment at very young ages. 

### Questions 
* What is the desired end product? Is the preference something static for a physical report or an interactive visualization? 
* What is the difference between mean years and expected years of schooling? How was this data collected? 
* Within the excel tab looking at labor in non-agricultural sector, the data for Sub-Saharan Africa is highlighted but missing? 
* Can we use found data from outside provided data sets ?
* http://hdr.undp.org/en/data The UNDP has recently provdied a much richer data set, which is available online from recent data visualization competition. Why aren’t we using this? 
* Are our only measurements of women’s increased involvement in the private sector coming directly from the companies themselves? 
* The HDI is from 2013, but the other factors are from 2000-2012, how are those numbers computed? Are the averages from all 12 years? And how is the HDI then calculated? Is there any way to see those numbers over time?
