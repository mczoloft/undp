## Project 1: [Agricultural Productivity Differences Between Male and Female Managed Farms](https://github.com/visualizedata/undp/blob/master/work/jaimetanner/AerialPhoto/index.html)
 
### Project 1 Research Question

 I am visualizing the gap in agricultural productivity between male-managed and female-managed plots of land. 
 
### Project 1 Description

This visual aims to give the reader a greater understanding of the loss of productivity due to the gender gap. The visual hopes to focus the reader on one datapoint at a time, and to illustrate what this agricultural loss may look like for each case addressed in the data set. 
 
### Project 1 Methodology

The only source used in this visualization is the data from question 3.2, as well as some information from the "Leveling the Field" report by the World Bank that is linked through the dataset.

## Project 2: [Child Marriage and the Gender Gap ](https://github.com/visualizedata/undp/blob/master/work/jaimetanner/Gaps/index.html)

### Project 2 Research Question

I am highlighting the relationship between the Gender Development Index and rates of child marriage in each country. 

### Project 2 Description

This project aims to show that there is a relationship between the gap in human development between men and women, and child marriage. Furthermore, rates of intimate partner violence within this unions will also be shown.  

### Project 2 Methodology

The child marriage statistics used in this project is from dataset 2.2. The GDI information is from dataset 1.1. Finally, information on intimate partner violence is available through a UNICEF report entitled "Hidden In Plain Sight", which is listed on the same page as the child marriage statistics that are used in 2.2.
