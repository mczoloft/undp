###2. Selected References

- Measuring Gender (In)Equality: Introducing the Gender, Institutions and Development Data Base (GID)
  - Introduces the OECD's database on Gender, Institutions and Development (GID). The GID attempts to improve the analysis of women's economic standing by making social institutions that affect women amenable to systematic comparison and analysis. These institutional variables include  norms, laws, codes of conduct, customs, and family traditions.
- New Measures of Gender Inequality: The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) and its Subindices
  - Based on the aforemention GID database, the paper models a new index to measure "long-lasting social institutions which are mirrored by societal practices and legal norms that might produce gender inequalities"A
- Why we should all care about social institutions related to gender inequality
  - Do the social institutions related to gender influence economic development? The paper uses the SIGI index for regression analysis to compare countries. The authors find that social insitutions that foster gender inequality are negatively associated with lower female education, higher fertility rates and higher child mortality. They also correlate with governance measured as rule of law and voice and accountability.

- Is there a political mandate to focus reporting on certain issues, such as food security (2012) and now gender?
- What are UNDP's vetting criteria for source data?
- What is the relationship between the DataViz we'll do and the report narrative as a whole?
