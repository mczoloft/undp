####No matter how wide the gender gap may be, we should never forget the dependency between men and women--as mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers--that lies at the root of a country's culture. This interactive visualization allows us to view the fragile balances between a country's economic well-being and roles of men and women in its labor force.
###Research Question
How can data on gender gaps in the labor force be viewed against broader economic indicators for a country and a region?

###Description
While gender gaps are deeply embedded in each country's and each region's cultural life, they are also affected by a variety of economic, political and social forces. This interactive visualization is a tool for investigation different types of gender-based data across country and region, and comparing those gaps to broader socio-economic indicators.

###Methodology
This chart employs both wage and business/labor data sets for men and women, and charts them against broader indicators for a country such as HDI rank and poverty head count ratio. The design works to highlight the divide between men and women, while never loosing sight of their inherent connection and dependance on each other.

#####Can you find Chad on blank map? Lestho? Eritrea? This application looks at education in Africa through many lenses: from the data to the actual schoolhouses.
###Research Question
What do we see when we look at the African Continent? How can Gender Equity become a lens for learning about Africa?

###Description
This project seeks to harness the power of interactive mapping by creating various lenses and scales through which we can learn about gender equity via Africa's rich and diverse geography. The project is a learning app and a data aggregator in one. It allows users to explore the continent, learn its geography and explore various levels and types of data.

###Methodology
The current source it draws from is the HDI and GDI data set, but I am building it with the potential to scale it to a variety of data sets, including qualitative data, research reports, and links for further information to each country.
