-## Tools, Users and Use Cases
+### Project 1 Description
+
- This project explores a visualization of the gender gap in the Human Development Index for each country in Africa. 
+
- My hypothesis is that every African country has a HDI gender gap.
+
- I aimed to show each country seperately in order to show the gender gap of HDI and also study if there is a correlation between the gap and the HDI overall for each country. Each country could be compared, but this study focuses on the individual country's gender HDI gap.
+
+### Project 1 Methodology
+
+The source I used was the HDR 2014. I wanted to focus on this one data set to strongly desplay the HDI without distraction.
+
+
+## Project 2: Comparision of Gross National Income, Education (Mean Years of Schooling), and Gender
+
+### Project 2 Research Question
+
I am highlighting the differences in Gross National Income and Education with regards to gender. I am also showing the relation of Education and Income.
+
+### Project 2 Description
+
- This project shows the gap in gross national income levels between males and females in Africa for each county. This also visualizes the mean years of schooling for males and females in Africa in comparison to the Gross National Incomes.
+
- My hypothesis is that there is a coorelation between gross national income, mean years schooling, and gender.
+
- Athough not every country has a GNI of Males hight than females,the majority are, and as countries GNI is higher, the larger the gap appears. Mean years of schooling also seems to be correlated with income levels. 
+
+### Project 2 Methodology
+
- My sources include the HDR, specifically the GNI and the Mean Years of Schooling. 
- I wanted to include parts of the HDI break down information to continue to study that difference in gender in my first project. I wanted to further develop my hypothesis to visulaize a reason behind the gender gap.
