High forest liana to divide a valley nuts to rubber
Plumed grass a gold and rock salt river
Outside Don Pecho and the Sea
To fertilize the granite shallows in dry season
myriad tormenting insects rage the course
Draw up low the inundation of a bad Pass tiny ten knot steamers
Lichens as puffy corals grown the ground all species considerable
Annual high density valuables travel the motor road
Sediments clearly express the rapids of white water
Weathered diversity enhanced by micronutrients
Narrows or Pongos no less missionary the little steamer
Lewis and brother-in-law to Matthew slave and wealth the rubber
Backwater latex trade expands three million miles
Andes to the Amazones woman an independent kingdom and a queen
To use the bow there is some indication only a single breast
Moon worship or the goddess is Diana
Asiatic Artemis herself an Amazon
Particularly water to Atlantic at Belem this longest river
on the earth is unknown at the source
From dusk a million bats fan out the night
Morning and evening raucous voice the Toucan clatter music
streamside bush goatsucker and the white whippoorwill
Giant armadillo and the second also eaten capybara
Through time the hangnets huge to watch and wait
With night alert to work in dead tree trunks or aerial processions
Of sand and clay both overlook the steep sea
Deep beds that disappear half east and west
Archipelago level wooded of a hundred humid days
Into Brazil from Para a scanty nomad tribe in thirsty possession
a vast and great display of reefs nineteen in number
Boiling torrent whirlpool swell Brazil uncertain
Three rafts American in August frightful torrents this the Orinoco
Pongo Maseriche only the gods ascend is the tradition water as river-torn
Ascend the Andes reaching is so gentle
