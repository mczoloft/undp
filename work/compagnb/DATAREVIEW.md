## Data Review
1. Selected Data Sources
    - 3.2 Modeling impacts on socio-economic indicators, food security, and poverty of gender equality and women’s empowerment
        -  3.1.1 What is the relationship between gender equality / women’s empowerment and 1) human development indicators, 2) food security, 3) poverty?
        - 3.2.2 What are the economic cost of gender gaps and inequality on growth and poverty reduction?
        - 3.3.3 What are the economic costs of gender gaps and inequality on socio-economic indicators?
        - 3.3.4 What are the costs of disparities in agriculture (e.g. access to land for women and men) in achieving food security and inclusive growth?
    
    - Research Question Formula: I am studing the impact of gender equality and women's empowerment on socio-economic indicators, food security and poverty to learn if the economic concerns are impacted by the gender issue in order to address economic concerns. 
    
    - My hypothesis is that the gender issue will be nominal and the economic concerns are larger addressed through engaging internal revenue equally.

        - This paper explores three main topics :
            - the gender-differentiated effects of globalization and economic policies
            - the effects of gender inequalities on economic policites
            - initiatives made to promote gender equality.
        - Some paper highlights:
            - Just as growth does not automatically trickle down to poor households, nor do income increases in poor households automatically trickle down to women and girls.
            - In addition to the different ways in which men and women have experienced globalization, there have been differences across different segments of women, differentiated by class

        - Systematic patterns in gender differentials suggest that low investment in women can reduce the rate of economic growth. Thus, societies that have a preference for not investing in girls will have a slower growth and reduced income.
