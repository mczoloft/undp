## Quantitative Data Assignment

The quantitative data assignment has been uploaded [here](https://github.com/visualizedata/undp/tree/master/work/compagnb/quantitativeData). It can also be viewed on c9 [here](https://major-studio-1-compagnb.c9.io/quantitativeData/Quantitative/index.html).

Findings: Originally this visualization was supposed to show concretely the growing or reduction in the human development indexes for both male and females (HDI/GDI). See inspiration [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7Q2btjMB9GsTmx4TVFFSDFpZVU&usp=sharing), sketches can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7Q2btjMB9GsalFhZ0FSYnYyRGc&usp=sharing).

With the lack of information distinguishing male and female HDI's found through out the course of years proving its movements either positive or negative make it hard to make a case of any of its causalities... or effects. I have started to rethinking how to make this more of a possibility. In stead of creating a visualization of the gap, I have marked the differences between male and female as lines, and will start to add layers marking poverty, agriculture and education levels for the current time frame. Images of the visualizations current state can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/a/newschool.edu/folderview?id=0B7Q2btjMB9GsX1R3M2s4NHlySGc&usp=sharing).
