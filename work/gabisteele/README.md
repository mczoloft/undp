#### 2.1 Economic Gender Gaps: Mapping Gaps and Country Benchmarking

What are the different ways that women and men engage in the economy?
What disparities exist in terms of economic opportunities for women and men?
How does women’s engagement in unpaid care work impact economic wellbeing at the household, community and national levels?

I am interested in learning more about the roles of women the current African economy and thus how these roles influence gender inequalities in the region. Because women have lesser access to education, how is the overall economy affected and what are the limitations in economic opportunities for women vs. men. What role do women’s expected household duties and unpaid care work responsibilities play in gender inequalities and lack of female involvement in the economy? How can we improve this?

#### 3.1 Estimating the cost of the gender gap on sustainable growth & structural transformation in Africa

What is the gender gap costing us? I’m interested in how severely the economy is being effected by gender inequalities in Africa relating to economic growth and social issues that are occurring due to lack of women’s rights and political presence. Number of women killed by intimate partners is high in this region. Issues with child marriage and spread of HIV infections are also high. 


#### 4.2 Political Economy of Gender Inequality & Women’s Empowerment

I’m interested in learning more about what exactly is causing such great disparities between women and men’s political, labor and economic participation the in sub-Saharan in Africa. What frameworks are being implemented to improve the situation and what protocols already exist in the region related to decreasing gender inequalities? 

Based of the data related to these issues it is clear that women’s life expectancy is consistently longer than men’s, though their education level and economic involvement is generally less. I’m trying to learn more about the causes of these disparities and what possible incentives can be found to work on reducing them and increasing women’s representation in leadership and the economy.

2. [Gender Disparities in Africa’s Labor Market](http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-0-8213-8066-6) 
    * Wages different significantly between men and women in sub-Saharan Africa
    * Could be due to discrimination in labor markets but also greatly influenced by lack of access to education.
    * Other influences include household duties women are required to perform
    * Overall causes of gender disparities are highly multifaceted, a combination of complex issues that come together to create the greater overarching problem of inequality
    * Solutions to this problem must therefore be equally multifaceted and well constructed if there is any chance of success.

* What supplemental sources can we use? World bank?
* What is the purpose of the data? What is the ultimate goal?
* How much of the current data has been used before? and what for?
