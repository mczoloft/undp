4.2 I’m interested in the political and economic gender inequalities that exist in sub-Saharan Africa and why these disparities exist, what caused them and what potential frameworks can be implemented to improve the situation and gaps between men and women. Based of the data related to these issues it is clear that women’s life expectancy is consistently longer than men’s in the region, though their education level and economic involvement is generally less. I’m trying to learn more about the causes of these disparities and what possible incentives can be found to work on reducing them and increasing women’s representation in leadership and the economy.
