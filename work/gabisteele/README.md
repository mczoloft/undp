##Project 1: Combating Gender Disparities in Education Levels for Children in Africa through Approachable Design
###[View Project](https://p5js-gabisteele.c9.io/undp/undp_Project1_Visualization/index.html)

###Research Question

I am visualizing data portraying how many years children are enrolled in school and the UN expectations for current students in their country's education system.

###Description

This project focuses on the current education systems in sub-saharan Africa, specifically how many years children spend in school. It highlights the significant disparities between girls and boys level of education and the overall lower level of schooling that is provided. It also provides insight on the expectations for current students in African schools suggesting an improvement in the number of years children complete. Though the task of combating gender inequality in sub-saharan Africa can seem overwhelming, education may be a hugely successful way of brightening girls futures in this region.

###Methodology

The data is sourced from the World Bank datasets provided through the UN for the purpose of these visualizations.

The project includes all information found within the dataset related to education which was broken down into mean years of schooling for boys, mean years of schooling for girls, expected years of school for boys and expected years of schooling for girls in each country in sub-saharan Africa. The countries are examined comparatively and can also be examined by regions. 

This project raises questions on what might be preventing girls from completing more years of school or at least as many as boys. One should also question the variance in expectations from one country to another in the same region on years of schooling for their children and why girls and boys have different levels of expectations. 

This visualization targets a younger audience of users rather than those already familiar with data from the sub-saharan African region who may already have some awareness of types of gender disparities existent there. This visualization portrays data in a non-traditional and loosely graph based way, utilizing an approachable and widely accessible method of design.

##Project 2: Investigating Opinions and Occurances of the Domestic Maltreatment of Women in Africa

###Research Question

I am visualizing data related to the domestic maltreatment of women in Africa and specific beliefs of the male and female populations regarding existing treatment of women. 

###Description

This visualization shares information on three main topics that deal with men vs womenâ€™s opinions on the treatment of girls and wives by their male counterparts. It portrays one branch of data on sexual assault of women in the region and two sets of data describing what the population thinks of how women are being treated in each country (related to domestic violence and female genital mutilation). Some countries have data that describes the progression of these beliefs and occurrences over various years in the past decade. 

###Methodology

The data is sourced from the latest sets provided by Angela and shown available on the UN web resources. 

The project includes a range of data varying in years over the course of a decade long period from several countries in the African region. It labels the years each set is drawn from and highlights regions where no data is currently available. 

The visualization will be designed to focus on concrete numbers that describe how many women in each country have had experienced genital mutilation and sexual assault in a given year, the potential decrease in these experiences over time and the comparative qualitative data that depicts the belief systems of male and female populations on the treatment of women in their society. Countries will be listed side by side and grouped by region in order to allow for clear visual comparisons. There will be several independent visualizations detailing the qualitative answers by each population on topics such as whether or not women should or should not be mutilated or what are circumstances under which is it appropriate for a husband to beat his wife. Followed by a summation of the quantitive data on how many women have suffered abuses in each country categorized by year, type of abuse, country and region.
