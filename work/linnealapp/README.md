## Data Review
###1. Selected Data Sources
####2.1 Economic Gender Gaps: Mapping Gaps and Country Benchmarking
- This data set includes data on the informal employment of women across select countries between 1991 and 1997, as well as data collected on the HDI (Human Development Index)
- The data presents opportunities for mapping employment and economic conditions across countries, in order to assess the economic landscape in relation to gender equality
- Economic factors such as trade, income, and employment/wage can be examined in relation to gender inequalities and exclusion in order to understand how gender affects imbalances in the economy

####2.2 Socio-Cultural Gaps: Mapping Gaps and Country Benchmarking
- This data set focuses on disparities between women and men from a social and cultural point of view including data about wage, business, and societal contstraints/freedoms.
- I am drawn to the everday aspect of specific data in this set such as family dynamics and social constraints associated with marriage or gender 
  - This creates an opportuniy to provide a snapshot into a woman's daily life in an African country
- There are also opportunities for mapping and working with geospatial data, and comparitive work (between countries/regions)

####3.1 Estimating the cost of the gender gap on sustainable growth & structural transformation in Africa
- This data set includes data on child marriage rates by country, violence against women, HIV among young men and women, and the HDI (Human Development Index)
- The data allows for an investigation of the social constraints placed on women by various social institutions, which leads to reduced female participation in the labor force therefore constraining economic development as well
- There is also an opportunity to look at the social cost of the gender gap on sustainable growth
- The topic of gender-based violence is extremely interesting to me and is a recognized global issue not only in Africa. The data from this set would provide the opportunity to investigate regional similarities and differences in gender-based violence and discuss its social and economic impacts.

#####CHAPTER 4: Human Development in Africa
- This chapter discusses the progress made in human development in Africa over recent years. Negative factors such as poverty, exclusion and gender inequality are still present within African countries, however the issues are being addressed more in recent years. Positive factors such as education, access to health, trade, access to technology and environmental sustainability are all playing key roles in the success of human development. Utilizing technology, innovation and global trade opportunities are key to furthering human rights in Africa. 

####2. Measuring Gender (In)Equality: Introducing the Gender, Institutions and Development Data Base (GID) (Johannes P. Jütting, Christian Morrisson, Jeff Dayton-Johnson and  Denis Drechsler)
- This paper addresses gaps related to social institutions in regard to women's economic status. Using an analytical tool called the Gender, Institutions and Development data base (GID), social dimensions of inequality towards women such as norms, laws, customs and family traditions are analyzed. The institutional setting in many countries constrains women from accessing the resources and rights which would allow them to participate fully in the labour force. The effect of these constraints on economic development and growth are consequently discussed.

#####CHAPTER 3: Gender and Macroeconomic Aggregates
- This chapter discusses the influence of gender on consumption and saving in the context of a household as a microeconomic unit. Gender effects who has control of and access to household resources; expenditure and saving priorities also vary depending on gender. Women in many countries state that their husbands have full control over household resources. However, women's economic consumption is more likely to benefit economic growth. This potential is due to women's tendency to spend money on things which will further the growth of their children, therefore increasing human capital. The chapter also discusses gender inequalities that exist within children's education.

###4. Questions
1. To what extent can the established questions be reworded in order to better focus our research for our visualizations?
2. Could the references be renamed in a more informative way?
3. What would be the best method for creating context for data which shows a subset of a population? (ex. For data which tells the number of HIV cases among men aged 15-24 in various countries, it would be beneficial to know the total number of men aged 15-24 in that country)
4. How does the naming of the topics apply to the structure of the report
5. How will the visualizations be included in the report (format/media)

###3-step formula:
1. I am trying to learn about the social institutions which constrain women in Africa...
2. Because I want to find out what the social/economic consequences are...
3. In order to help my reader understand the effect of gender specific social constraints on sustainable development in Africa
